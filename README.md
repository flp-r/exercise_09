# *De Novo* Genome Assembly

## The Greedy Shortest Common Superstring
### Task
* In R, implement a function `GreedySuperstring()` according to the pseudocode.

* Input:
    * `S` A `DNAStringSet` of strings (reads).

* Output:
   * `S` A `DNAStringSet` of the shortest common superstring (contig).

> **Hint:** 
> Create also functions:
> * `Overlap()` to calculate overlap between two sequences.
> * `OverlapMatrix()` to create a matrix of overlaps among all sequences in `S`.

```
GreedySuperstring(S)
1   while length of S > 1
2     overlapMat <- OverlapMatrix(S)
3     if max(overlapMat) = 0
4       return S
5     else
6       seq1, seq2 ← Two sequences from S with the longest overlap
7       Merge seq1 and seq2 and add the new sequence to S
8       Remove seq1 and seq2 from S
9   return S
```
